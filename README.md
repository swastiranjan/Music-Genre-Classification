##  Music Genre Classification (GTZAN Dataset)

This project classifies music into 10 genres using audio features extracted from the GTZAN dataset.
A Random Forest classifier is trained on both 30-second and 3-second versions of the dataset.

### Results
Dataset	Samples	Accuracy
30-second clips	1000	78%
3-second sliced clips	~10,000	87% ✔️

The 3-second dataset greatly improves accuracy due to more training samples.
